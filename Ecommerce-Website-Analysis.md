# THE OBJECTIVE

Use SQL to:
Extract and analyze traffic and website performance data to craft a growth story that your
CEO can sell. Dive into the marketing channel activities and the website improvements that
have contributed to your success to date, and use the opportunity to flex your analytical skills
for the investors while youâ€™re at it.
As an Analyst, the first part of your job is extracting and analyzing the data. The next (equally
important) part is communicating the story effectively to your stakeholders.

Our business is on the rise! The latest numbers, even though the last quarter is incomplete, show strong growth in both sessions and order volumes. Things are looking up! 
For the last incomplete quarter, we've opted to exclude it from our analysis to ensure a consistent and reliable trend across complete data points.
## Task 2: Showcase Efficiency Improvements

- [ ] Showcase quarterly figures, since the launch, for session-to-order conversion rate.
- [ ] Showcase quarterly figures, since the launch, for revenue per order.
- [ ] Showcase quarterly figures, since the launch, for revenue per session.
