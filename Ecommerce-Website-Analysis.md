# THE OBJECTIVE

Use SQL to:
Extract and analyze traffic and website performance data to craft a growth story that your
CEO can sell. Dive into the marketing channel activities and the website improvements that
have contributed to your success to date, and use the opportunity to flex your analytical skills
for the investors while youâ€™re at it.
As an Analyst, the first part of your job is extracting and analyzing the data. The next (equally
important) part is communicating the story effectively to your stakeholders.
